# endcorp
endcorp is a consultancy that writes code for your startup. We primarily focus on projects that are data-centric, and are greenfield projects.

We have expertise on full stack development of app on any platform, ML tech stacks, and work with various cloud providers. We can work in your stack and with your existing tech team to come up with solutions by working with you and tools you aready use as opposed to having you conform to "our ways".

## Philosophy

Our philosophy is that the most simple and obviou solution to a problem should be attempted first, and if it does not work, it needs to be triaged and another attempt is to be made. Every action a team or an individual developer intends to make must be constrained by a timeline and if productive code is not being delivered on a regular basis, then something is wrong and must be addressed

## Tools

From time to time we will publish tools we find useful. They will be available as public repositories on this account and be hosted at domains defined in the README.md file of that repo. Most code will be open source and free to use without any permission, if not the README file will say so.
